SkyFortress
===========

**[(Live demo)](http://shxdhomhggy3bjrn.onion/skyfortress/)**

A small, secure, and easy to use encrypted filehost. 

*Note*: All the info found in this readme can also be found in skyfortress.php. It's also likely more up to date than this readme file is.

**Legal**

I don't care what you do with this file. If you have the source, all of the work I've put in this may as well be yours. You can take my name off of it, change the name of the software, you can do *ANYTHING* you want with it. 'Mi casa es su casa' as the Spanish would say. All I ask is that, if you do use this source elsewhere, that you not use it for malicious purposes and that you not try to view what users upload without their knowledge.

**Credits**

* Me, for writing the code (obviously)
* The good people who developed PHP
* The [phpSecLib](http://phpseclib.sourceforge.net/) dev team, for their AES and Rjindael libraries 

**Installation**

* 1.) Drop skyfortress.php wherever you want with whatever name you want.
* 2.) Chmod this file to 777.
* 3.) Create a folder named "crypt" in the same directory.
* 4.) Chmod that folder to 777.
* 5.) Spread the link around. :)
